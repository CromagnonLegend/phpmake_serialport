# Gorilla â€” PHPMake\SerialPort

I decided to make this package user-friendly by automating the process for installation of the package and making it composer-friendly

A PHP extension for communicating with serial-port devices (e.g. Arduino, AVR, PIC) on POSIX systems (Linux/macOS) and Windows.
This is a standalone PHP extension created using CodeGen_PECL 1.1.3
It[the package] was tested only on Linux so if it doesn't work on your machine or you find any non-breaking bugs reach me out - i'll try fixing 'em

### Note: I recommend, if you're on Windows OS, to stick to the quick install via Composer
